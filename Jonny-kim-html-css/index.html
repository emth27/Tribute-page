            <h2>The Life of Jonny Kim</h2>
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Jonathan Yong Kim (born 5 February 1984), also called Jonny Kim, is an American U.S. Navy lieutenant
                commander (former SEAL), physician, and NASA astronaut. </p>
            <p>Born and raised in California, Kim enlisted in the U.S. Navy in the early 2000s before earning a Silver
                Star and his commission. While a U.S. sailor, Kim also received his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics with
                distinction, his Doctor of Medicine, and an acceptance to NASA Astronaut Group 22 in 2017. He completed
                his astronaut training in 2020 and was awaiting a flight assignment with the Artemis program as of
                December 2020. </p>

            <h3>Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Jonathan Yong Kim was born on 5 February 1984 in Los Angeles, California. His parents emigrated from
                South Korea to the United States in the early 1980s, and his father had scarcely completed a
                high-school education. The family opened a liquor store in South Los Angeles, and his mother worked as a
                substitute elementary school teacher while raising Kim and his younger brother. In a 2018 interview
                with Annals of Emergency Medicine, Kim described himself as "the epitome of that quiet kid who just
                lacked complete self-confidence." In 2020, The Chosun Ilbo reported that the adolescent Kim had been
                the victim of domestic violence at the hands of his father; in February 2002, after threatening his
                family with a gun, Kim's father was shot to death in his attic by police.</p>
            <p>At Santa Monica High School, Kim received high grades in his classes, including several Advanced
                Placements, while participating in swimming and water polo; he graduated in 2002. Kim received a
                Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, in mathematics from the University of San Diego in 2012, and a Doctor
                of Medicine from Harvard Medical School in 2016. Kim was a Pat Tillman Foundation "Tillman Scholar"
                selectee. In 2017, Kim completed his medical internship in emergency medicine at Massachusetts General
                Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>
            <p>As of January 2020, Kim was married with three children.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <h3>U.S. Navy</h3>
            <p>Kim learned about and decided to become a Navy SEAL at age 16, investing his remaining high-school years
                physically conditioning himself for the rigors of Special Warfare training. Of this decision, Kim said,
                "Going into the Navy was the best decision I ever made in my life because it completely transformed that
                scared boy who didn't have any dreams to someone who started to believe in himself."</p>
            <p>After enlisting with the United States Navy in 2002 as a seaman recruit, Kim graduated BUD/S class 247
                and was assigned to SEAL Team 3 with the rating Special Warfare Operator. He deployed twice to the
                Middle East and participated in over 100 combat missions as a combat medic, sniper, navigator, and point
                man. During his tenure with the SEALs, Kim served with PO2s Marc Alan Lee and Michael A. Monsoor.
                In 2009, Kim was accepted to the STA-21 commissioning program; when he graduated from the
                University of San Diego in 2012 and left the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps, Kim entered the
                Medical Corps.</p>
            <p>On 6 June 2022, Kim completed his first solo flight in a Beechcraft T-6 Texan II at the Naval Air
                Training Command, part of a common training regimen for U.S. Navy – NASA astronauts who lacked previous
                military pilot experience.</p>
            <p>Kim is a recipient of a Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal (with Combat "V"), the Navy and Marine Corps
                Commendation Medal (with Combat "V"), and Combat Action Ribbon. According to Jocko Willink, Kim's
                Silver Star was awarded for rescuing multiple wounded Iraqi soldiers in the face of enemy fire. As
                of March 2022, Kim was still described as a SEAL with the rank of lieutenant commander.</p>

            <h3>NASA</h3>
            <p>While studying at Harvard Medical School, Kim met and was inspired by astronaut–physician Scott E.
                Parazynski to apply for Astronaut Candidacy. On June 7, 2017, Kim was one of twelve candidates
                chosen from a pool of over 18,300 applicants to join NASA Astronaut Group 22. He reported for duty
                on 21 August 2017, and graduated from training on 10 January 2020.</p>
            <p>According to NASA, Kim will work in the Astronaut Office while awaiting a flight assignment. On 9
                December 2020, NASA formally announced that Kim would join 17 other astronauts in training for a 2024
                Moon landing. In April 2021, he was selected as Increment Lead for Expedition 65.</p>
